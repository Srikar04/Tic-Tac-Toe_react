# Tic Tac Toe React App

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using React.js. It allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. Players also have the ability to go back to any moves they made during the game.

The app is hosted at [https://srikar04.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe_react/](https://srikar04.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe_react/).

## Features

- Winner announcement: Displays the winner or declares a draw when the game is over.

- Move history: Keeps track of the moves made during the game.
- Time travel: Allows players to go back to any previous move and continue the game from that point.
